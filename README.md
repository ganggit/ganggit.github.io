## Welcome to a machine learning Page

This is a site of the [machine learning book](https://github.com/ganggit/ganggit.github.io/edit/master/machine_learning.pdf), with the purpose to create a community with resource sharing and learning.

## Introduction

This book is a beginner's guide to study machine learning, with focus on basic methods and algorithms. It aimed at senior undergraduates, graduate students
and researchers in areas, such as computer science, bioinformatics, statistics and psychology. It is helpful for readers to be familiar with elementary calculus, linear algebra and probability before understanding the concepts and contents in this book. To make it easy to understand, we also provider basic mathematic references in Appendix A and B.

Our focus is on machine learning basics, models and also the recent trends. More specifically, we provide the most widely used mathematical models, derivation and optimization techniques. We intentionally avoid the experiments and evaluations because machine learning models are sensitive to various settings and datasets. Instead, this book is more like a tutorial of machine learning methods and algorithms, with the hope that readers can understand the basics and learn how to derive equations and optimize a given objective function. This means this book will mainly present methods and approaches to different machine learning problems. 

In addition, this book covers most machine learning topics, such as surprised learning, unsupervised learning and semi-supervised learning. Considering metrics playing a vital role to learn models, we start with similarity measures and build all topics based on these fundamentals. Most chapters will introduce a distinct family of machine learning models given different training inputs, with focus on understanding the models throughly. While we cannot reflect the most advances in machine learning, the mathematic methods and logics will lay solid foundations for readers to learn and handle more complex situations in different applications. 


## Book content

This book covers this main topics in machine learning: supervised learning, semi-supervised learning and unsupervised learning. 

### Supervised learning

It discusses classification and regression. We focus on perceptron learning, support vector machines (SVMs) and (logistic) regression. 

### Unsupervised learning

It focuses on clustering methods, such as k-means, gaussian mixture models and spectral clustering. Also we discuss bayesian nonparametric models for clustering. 

### Semi-supervised learning 

As a mixture of the above topics, it highlights the classification problems with partial labels and clustering problems with pairwise constraints. 

### Current trends

The final chapter focuses the current hot topics, especially deep learning. We cover restricted Boltzmann machines, deep neural/deep belief networks and recurrent neural networks. And we give math in details on how to derive gradients and update model with different learning methods. 

### Appendix
It provides the math basics, such as linear algebra, probability and sets. Also it discusses quadratic optimization approaches.
